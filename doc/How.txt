The analyser will determine the emotion of a sentence based
on a pointing system.

Thoses points are: 
- Positive: Does the word invoke a nice feeling?
- Energy: Does the word invoke a energetic feeling?

Those points can range between -10 to 10.

The analyser will sum up those points and return an emotion.

For example:

"This seems fun."

The words "This" and "seems" both have 0 in 'Positive' and
0 'Energy'. The word "fun" has 3 in 'Positive' and 3 in 'Energy'.
This sentence will have a total of 3 'Positive' and 3 'Energy'
wich will result in a happy feeling.

To make things a bit more real, the punctuations will have an
important impact in the emotions. For example, an exclamation mark will automatically put 5 or higher in the 'Energy' points
and will double the 'Positive' points.
A simple point will limit 'Energy' between -3 and 3.

Example:

"This seems fun!"

Because of the exclamation point, 'Positive' is now worth 6.
'Energy'will be atleast 5, but since "fun" got 3 in 'Energy', we
will end up with 8 in 'Energy'. This will result in a joyful feeling.

But there is way more to take in consideration.
For example, adjectives and adverbs will have an amplification
effect. We also got words like "but" that usually come will a total change of mood. Plus, "This is good!" doesn't have the same feeling as "THIS IS GOOD!".

Those things must be taken in consideration by the anaylser.
